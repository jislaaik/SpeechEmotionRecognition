# SpeechEmotionRecognition
In this repository I built a deep learning approach that can recognize emotion from speech. All this is part of a module in the course "Machine Learning Lab" by Ulf Brefeld.

The first notebook "SER Part 1 - Build dataset + 1D CNN.ipynb" covers the creation of the dataset and a simple 1D CNN. The second notebook "SER Part 2 - 2D CNN.ipynb" covers the whole 2D CNN appraoch.
